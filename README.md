# Analyzing Population Codes in Mice using Spiking Neural Networks

This is the repsitory containing the code for the project in the course AM226: Theory of Neural Computation at Harvard.

The code for the experiments are found in `analysis.ipynb`. Make sure to create a folder called `natural_images`, and download and add following files to it:
- `natimg2800_M170714_MP032_2017-09-14.mat`
- `stimuli_class_assignment_confident.mat`
- `images_natimg2800_all.mat`

### Acknowledgements
The code and experiements are based on those found in [Pehlevan-Group](https://github.com/Pehlevan-Group/sample_efficient_pop_codes). 
This provided a great starting point when I had no prior experience with the data set and little prior knowledge of the experiments. 
Thank you!

Also, the implementation of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) closely follows that found in this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sLPjjMCmldwOxOQL5QPZMKqziVCBnga_?usp=sharing#scrollTo=2p3a39yvfA2M). With no prior knowledge of or experience with SNNs, they can be a pain to set up and fine tune. This repository made my live much better. Thank you!
