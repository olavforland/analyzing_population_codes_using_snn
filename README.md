# Analyzing Population Codes in Mice using Spiking Neural Networks

This is the repsitory containing the code for the project in the course AM226: Theory of Neural Computation at Harvard.

The code for the experiments are found in `analysis.ipynb`. Make sure to create a folder called `natural_images`, and download and add following files to it:
- `natimg2800_M170714_MP032_2017-09-14.mat`
- `stimuli_class_assignment_confident.mat`
- `images_natimg2800_all.mat`

### Acknowledgements
The code and experiements are based on that found in [Pehlevan-Group](https://github.com/Pehlevan-Group/sample_efficient_pop_codes). 
This provided a great starting point when I had no prior experience with the data set and little prior knowledge of the experiments. 
Thank you!
